          These Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of toptrt.io

        <h2 className="pt-4 text-xl font-semibold text-[#191919]">Informational Purpose Only - Not Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>
          Top TRT is an independent comparison and information publisher. All content is provided
          for general informational purposes only and is <strong>not medical advice</strong>. We are not
          a doctor, pharmacy, or telehealth provider, and using the Site does not create a
          doctor-patient relationship. Testosterone replacement therapy is a prescription treatment,
          prescribed and monitored by a licensed clinician, with risks and potential side effects.
          Always consult a licensed healthcare professional before making any medical decision or
          starting, stopping, or changing a treatment.
