  },
  {
    question: "Why do some providers show no customer rating on your pages?",

          <p className="mb-4 text-[16px] leading-[1.75] text-gray-600">
            Every price on this site comes straight from each provider&rsquo;s own published rates,
            and we record four things for each one: the headline rate, the regular rate behind any
            promotion, the condition attached (plan length, first-month rate, per-dose vs. monthly
            pricing), and the shipping terms. A number is never published without its condition.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[16px] leading-[1.75] text-gray-600">
            When a provider changes its published pricing, we re-verify against its site and every
            affected page - reviews, head-to-heads and cost breakdowns - is revised, with the
            &ldquo;last updated&rdquo; date refreshed so you always know how current a figure is.

            consistently positive recent customer feedback move a score up; hidden fees, thin medical
            support, or recurring complaints move it down.

                provider that wins the majority of categories takes the matchup, and the advantage
                meter reflects how decisive that edge is. We always name the runner-up&rsquo;s genuine
                strengths, because the &ldquo;better&rdquo; provider still depends on what you value most.
